# Map_Genereator

This project is a work in progress.

The current goal is to write an application that will generate a map within the specified dimensions using a given tile-set. 
These maps can be used, for example, in making tabletop RPG encounters.

The end goal is to have a working map generation algorithm that can be used in Unity to generate instanced dungeons in games.
